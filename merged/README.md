This is the directory, where the merged dataset will be stored and where
the R-code from this repository expects it to be.

Make sure you run the jupyter notebook from this repository first, to generate the merged dataset.

The scond part of the R-code, vlevsscoreV2.R, does not require you to have the merged dataset.
